          Although &quot;Adele&quot; sold over 28 million albums in 2011, she is the only one in our current decade who has been able to sell that many copies. The massive hit band &quot;One Direction&quot; only managed to sell 4 million copies in 2013. Only three songs managed to pass the 5 million sales mark in 2013. Even the album from the hit movie in 2014: &quot;Frozen&quot;, only sold 10 million copies world wide.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2014, the total amount of albums sold were 257 million. Only 140.8 million of those were CD's.

          </h3>
          <p>
            It's not just your band that's having a hard time. Your average famous artist is struggling as well. There is so little money in album sales nowadays with the increase in song streams, the record/booking labels often have to up the prices on concert tickets to be able to go around. Most bands nowadays make more money from playing shows and selling merchandise. (t-shirts, hoodies etc.)
