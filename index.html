            Although &quot;Adele&quot; sold over 28 million albums in 2011, she is the only one in our current decade who has been able to sell that many copies. The massive hit band &quot;One Direction&quot; only managed to sell 4 million copies in 2013. Only three songs managed to pass the 5 million sales mark in 2013. Even the album from the hit movie in 2014: &quot;Frozen&quot;, only sold 10 million copies world wide.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2014, the total amount of albums sold were 257 million. Only 140.8 million of those were CD's.

            Spotify payments varies from 0.048 to 0.064kr per streamed song. That means that if you had
